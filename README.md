# RefactorHW

## Description
Refactored code to include semantic tags. By including the semantic tags it makes it easier to read the code. Also added alt tags for images and updated css to include newly implemented semantic tags. By refactoring this code I learned how to better use semantic tags and alt tags which will allow my code to be easier to follow in the future.

## User Story
Codebase that has alt tags. By codebase having alt tags we follow accecibility standards thus allowing a UI for all.

## Directions
Refactor code to include semnatic tags and alt tags. Also add comments to CSS and update so any changes with semantic tags will still apply to elements.

## Acceptance Criteria
Webpage meets accecibility standards
Source code is refactored and includes html semantic tags
Source code is easier to follow and correctly tagged

## Mockup
The following is what web page should look like with alt tags for images.
